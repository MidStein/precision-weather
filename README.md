# weather-app
A simple weather forecasting website useful for making decisions regarding day to day work and travel. Users can enter their location and almost instantly all kinds of handy information like type of weather, temperature, pressure, humidity will be available at their fingertips. The data will be displayed with cute and funny gifs to keep the user engaged.

By making this project I will learn to handle APIs and filtering out useful data from them. As fetching API data is an asynchronous task, another goal of this project is to learn how to write asynchronous javascript code using promises, async/await and how to handle errors. Form validation will also be slightly touched on while making this.
